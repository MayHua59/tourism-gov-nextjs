 * - Keep the structure: an array of regions, each with a `region` name and `sites` array.
 * - Each site object can contain: title, summary (HTML or plain text), location, area, accessibility.
 *
 * Example:
 * {

 *   sites: [

 *       title: "Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, Sagaing Region",

 * Currently this constant contains empty placeholders so the page renders by looping the structure.
