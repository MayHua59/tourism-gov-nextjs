            <h2>Seize Investment Opportunities in Myanmar in TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY</h2>
            <p>
              The Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar warmly invites responsible investors to seek and seize business opportunities in Myanmar to accelerate sustainable economic growth. At the moment, foreign tourists (on their first short-term visit to Myanmar) mostly visit Yangon, Bagan, Inle Lake / Nyaung Shwe as well as Mandalay. However, Myanmar has unexplored treasures of natural beauty in the whole of the country from Kawthaung in the tropical South-east to Putao in the Himalayas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The table displays the current distribution of hotels, motels and inns/guesthouses in Myanmar and reflects the considerable under capacity of available accommodation in numerous locations outside the urban centers of Yangon and Mandalay. There is a need for both, affordable as well as high-class accommodation depending on the current demand.

              Foreign investors may engage independently in hotel developments of 3-stars or higher standard, whereby local investors are encouraged also to consider opportunities in offering budget accommodation through guesthouses of international standards. For foreign entities, investments in tour companies, travel agencies, budget hotels, amusement parks and tourism-related public infrastructure projects are permitted on a joint-venture basis.
